# Style loader

> This is an example integrating with style-loader

### Inspiration

I want to demonstrate that a-css-loader can be a complete replacement for [webpack/css-loader]() for most use cases.

### Setup

```
$ npm install
```

### Build

```
$ npm run build
```
 
### Result

`build/index.html` will create a style tag with the generated styles
