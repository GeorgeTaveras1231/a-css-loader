# Extract Text

> This is an example integrating with extract-text-webpack-plugin

### Inspiration

It is a really common practice to build application css as a separate file(s). [webpack/extract-text-webpack-plugin]() allows you to extract the css into a separate file.

### Setup

```
$ npm install
```

### Build

```
$ npm run build
```

### Configuration

The configurations are not anything special. Following the instructions in [ webpack/extract-text-webpack-plugin]() will yield similar working results.

 
### Result

`build` folder will have an `application.css` file.
